# Develop and validate UART VIP

## Introduce
My name is Nguyen Van Huy, and I am a course participant at ICTC (IC Training Center Vietnam). This article presents my work on develop and validate UART VIP, a project I have completed as part of my course at ICTC. The goal of this article is to show the knowledge and skills I have gained through my studies at ICTC and to demonstrate my abilities to potential employers in the field of Design Verification.

UART is an asynchronous communication protocol using a start bit to begin transmission, a data frame for actual data (5-9 bits), an optional parity bit for error checking, and stop bits to signal the end. Baud rate determines data transfer speed. Common baud rates include 4800, 9600, 19200, 57600 and 115200 bps.

## Summary of Input Documents for UART

In this section, I have summarized the key points from the "UART Specification" and the "UART Slide" provided by the center.
